Problem: Constraint Optimization Problem

Notes:

 1. It is recommanded to use Microsoft Visual Studio to run the coding as it was used to develop it.
 2. Additional four (4) files were submitted together with the source code named TEST.cpp in the zip folder called Code.zip. The four (4) files (pbPlots.hpp, supportLib.hpp, pbPlots.cpp, supportLib.cpp) are under the package called pbplots which intendeds to generate a performance graph for each run.
 3. When using Visual Studio, please create a new project and drag the coding files into the project (.hpp files under header files and .cpp under source files).
 4. Upon successfully running the code, a png image named plot.png will be created in the source directory which contains the performance graph of the run (This will be automatically opened when the coding reaches max generation).
 5. If you encounter any problem with the coding or not being able to run the coding, please contact Nahvin Muthusamy (b031910127@student.utem.edu.my).
